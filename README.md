# Data-Science-with-Interesting-Datasets


This repository contains two data science projects based on interesting public datasets. The projects showcase skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and deriving actionable insights from diverse data sources.

**Project 1: Analysis of Australian Non-Profits**

This project explores the financial, operational, and demographic data of Australian charities and not-for-profits. The dataset is sourced from the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC), Australia's national charity regulator. Each year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS), which collects valuable information on their activities, governance, and finances.

**Project 2: Collegiate Basketball Tournament Outcomes**

This project focuses on analyzing historical data from collegiate basketball tournaments to uncover key factors influencing game outcomes. The dataset, a popular choice for data science competitions, provides detailed statistics on team performance, tournament seeds, and game results from various years.

The dataset is part of the March Machine Learning Mania 2025, it can be accessed here - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/march-machine-learning-mania-2025/overview
